# GraphTypes

This document describes the types of graphs and charts that are appropriate for different combinations of variables. (This forms part of the QUARC data visualization workshop.)

There is a long version that includes several "graphing by hand" exercises first. The short version skips this stuff, but otherwise is exactly the same.

These presentations are also hosted on RPubs:
